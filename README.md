#### Project Overview

> **Goal**: Predict a personâ€™s monthly carbon emissions (in kg COâ‚‚) based on lifestyle factors like transport, diet, energy usage, and waste management  
> **Type**: End-to-end ML Project | Dashboard | Environmental Awareness  
> **Audience**: Students, researchers, environmentally-conscious users, and data science enthusiasts

#### Objectives

- Perform detailed **EDA** to uncover patterns in carbon-emitting behaviors
- Engineer meaningful features using real-world COâ‚‚ equivalence mappings
- Build and compare multiple **regression models**
- Create a **Streamlit dashboard** to visualize insights and estimate emissions interactively
